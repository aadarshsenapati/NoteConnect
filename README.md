# Crowdsourced Study Notes Platform
### Introduction 
This is a crowdsourced study notes platform empowering students to share and access high-quality academic resources. It fosters collaboration, enabling peer-to-peer learning and creating a comprehensive repository for diverse subjects. Together, we make studying more effective and accessible for everyone in the university.


### Objective
